### Usage
This repository is a flake, you can add it as an input (or consume it in any other way you prefer).

Packages are exposed as `packages.${system}.<package-name>`, so you can do
`inputs.tundra.packages.${system}.hello` as an example.

Other expressions are (will be?) exposed under `lib.<expression-name>`. There aren't any yet...

### Packages
